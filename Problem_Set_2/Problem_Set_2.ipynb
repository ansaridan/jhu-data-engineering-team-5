Another relationship is a distribution, as we can look at the frequencies of each age interval and calculate a count for each one."

    "According to William Cleveland's research, angles are more difficult to decode than something like length, so pie charts in general are not a great tool for making an easy to read chart versus something like a bar chart. We also have the use of color here, which has no meaningful value in this chart - why is 20-29 red and why is 50-59 blue? Based on Colin Ware's _Attributes of Form_. Finally, what does it mean that the 90-99 age group has a value of -1% ? Births maybe? Clearly we shouldn't have a negative percentage when looking at these relationships, and in fact adding all of the other age groups, we come out to a total of 100%. So why is the 90-99 group even included here?"

    "<div style=\"background: lemonchiffon; margin:20px; padding: 20px;\">\n",
    "    <strong>Note</strong>\n",

    "1. View [Top 100 Contractors of the U.S. federal government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top_100_Contractors_of_the_U.S._federal_government).\n",
    "2. Scroll down to the footnotes. If you follow footnote 7, you can obtain the raw data for FY2015 which is an Excel file. \n",
    "\n",
    "    The Excel file is divided into tabs. The first tab covers all the Federal government while the remaining tabs cover departments and sub-departments. **We are only interested in departments** which means we don't want spending from the first tab (although you may want the contractor information) and we don't want sub-departments. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    A department will have a code that ends with \"00\". For example, \"9700\" is the Defense Department but \"9761\" is \"Defense Threat Reduction\". We're not interested in the latter.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Create a SQLite3 database, `contracts.db`, of the department specific actions (contracts) and dollar amounts. It should have **two** tables. The first, `contractors`, should have an id (as a primary key) and a global_vendor_name (as a varchar). The second, `actions`, should include an id (primary key), department, actions (number of actions), dollars (dollars obligated) and contractor_id as a foreign key to the contractors table. Follow the same pattern as in the Lab. All your database and table creation (DDL) commands will be in `contracts.sql`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Reading the Excel file and creating the database should be automated with no cutting and pasting so that you could regenerate the database for a corrected file or for FY2016 (assuming it had the same format). Both `xlrd` and `openpyxl` are included in Anaconda. (Translating the file from .xls to .xlsx *is* permitted but may not be required). Place this \"ETL\" code in a separate `contracts.py` file and include it with your submission.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, you should have:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `contracts.sql` will create the data schema.\n",
    "2. `contracts.py` will fill the database tables with the correct data from the Excel spreadsheet.\n",
    "3. `contracts.db` will have the data in it.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this ETL part, we will grade you based on the correctness of your solution (did you put the right things in the right files, etc.) and the integrity of the database (are the tables correct, with the correct number of rows, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "<div style=\"background: lemonchiffon; margin:20px; padding: 20px;\">\n",
    "    <strong>Note</strong>\n",
    "    <p><strong>None</strong> of your ETL should appear in this notebook. It will be in the files above.</p>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "For the following questions, you should connect to `contracts.db`, using the sqlite3 library (**without** using Pandas) and provide answers to the following questions, nice formatted (you may use the `tabulate`, if you like). Remember the formula: discuss/code/discuss, after you get a query result, you should discuss anything salient in the result. Make whatever additional markdown/code cells you might need but do not delete anything already here."
