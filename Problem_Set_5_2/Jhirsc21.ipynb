You may also consult Stackoverflow, etc. This is not by any means \"closed book\" or anything like that. Basically, I need to see if *you* learned the concepts from the Lectures, *Fundamentals*, and Labs.\n",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Labs 9, 10, and 11 were all about linear models, specifically linear and logistic regression, and evaluation. We learned how to build and interpret multivariate models by using domain knowledge, comparing the predicted and actual values of the coefficients and the credible intervals, and looking at residuals. We also applied transformations to make the models perform better and increase interpretability. However, please remember all previous modules are in affect. For example, you should use all our rules for visualization. ETL involves only data acquisition and *cleaning*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the techniques covered during Modules 9 and 10 (lectures, labs, course notes), **build, describe, and use** a linear regression model that estimates the target variable `mpg` for the accompanying auto data set. Again, Module 11's content is probably relevant.\n",
    "\n",
    "Do **not** use any feature selection techniques or anything other than linear regression. **Follow the method described in class.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The instructions say **build**, **describe**, and **use**. You must describe all aspects of your final model (all the parameters and metrics) and use it to make three predictions as described in the course notes."

    "$mpg$ is our target variable. As such, we will see a lot relationships between mpg and the others during our pairwise analysis. This is a numeric variable and as such, we can find descriptive statistics for it. Typical fuel economy of cars can range from 10 mpg for larger cars like SUVs to about 30 mpg for more mid-sized cars. My car, which is considered more fuel efficient, gets closer to 30 mpg, so I imagine that's a bit higher than average.\n",
